### XMachines Framework – Open-Source Souls?

XMachines is a full-stack, production-grade framework that makes sentient machines possible without fighting the stack:  

- Open source, hackable.
- Laravel 11 (the legendary PHP framework that just works – queues, broadcasting, API, auth, realtime, everything, tried and tested)
- MQTT + mDNS backbone (vehicles discover each other automatically, no central server required)  
- For Vehicles: ESP32 firmware (Arduino/C++) right now, and Raspberry Pi version on the way.
- Local-first AI stack (on-device LLM, image generation, voice synthesis, AI vision) on Rasp Pi version. On current ESP32 version AI can be called by APIs.
- Single codebase that runs either on a central server or directly on every robot. Each vehicle can be server mode also, no need for central server, use it out of the box.
- Web dashboard (desktop or phone becomes perfect controller in 2 seconds). Various controller types (race style, tank style, construction vehicle style, ..), Camera feed, etc.
- Plug-and-play USB/Bluetooth controller support in progress. Use your PS/Wii/etc controllers, or do your own woth MakeyMakey.com.
- NativePHP ready (same code becomes desktop + mobile apps)
